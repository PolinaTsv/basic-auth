##User Registration and Authentication using Express.js, ironlauncher

This code snippet demonstrates the essential steps for user registration and authentication within an Express.js application. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. ###Routes
GET /signup: Renders the user registration form.
POST /signup: Handles user registration by securely hashing and storing user passwords in the database.
2. ###Password Security
Utilizes bcryptjs to securely hash passwords, ensuring user data remains protected.
3. ###Database Integration
Saves user data, including the hashed password, into a User model (assumes the model exists).
4. ###User Profile
Includes a placeholder route for displaying user profiles (/userProfile), but rendering logic isn't provided here.
This code provides a foundational structure for implementing user registration and authentication in a Node.js application. You can adapt and expand upon it to meet the specific requirements of your project.
